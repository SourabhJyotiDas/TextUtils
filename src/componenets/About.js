            <span >TextUtils</span> is designed to be a free to use online text manipulator that you can use for efficiency and productivity gains (and in some cases just a bit of fun as well). Whether you have mistakenly written all your text in capital or you want to quickly align the correct capitalisation structure for titles. Convert Case allows you to quickly fix any errors as well as produce an array of outcomes from the tools above.

            There are also a range of converters to explore as well such as the binary code and morse code translators that will allow you to write up standard text and have it translated into the necessary code.

            You can also use the text manipulators to allow your text to stand out. Whether thatâ€™s for social media purposes or you want to bring some attention to an advertisement, these tools are a great solution for fixing those issues too.

            Explore the full set of tools.

            Of course, if you have any suggestions over new tools that should be added and created that could help benefit, then by all means, please get in touch with us and we will be more than happy to help you.
